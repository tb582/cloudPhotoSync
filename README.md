# pcloudRclone Sync

PowerShell automation that coordinates rclone with Google Drive File Stream to keep a pCloud remote in sync with a local photo library. The script performs:

- Remote listing and deduplication of files via rclone
- MD5 hashsum comparison against local state
- Optional rclone copy operations for new/changed files
- Graceful stop/start of Google Drive File Stream while the sync runs
- Detailed logging to text files and the Windows Event Log

## Prerequisites

- **Windows PowerShell 5.1 or PowerShell 7+**
- **[rclone](https://rclone.org/downloads/)** installed and configured with a remote (defaults expect it to be called `remote:`)
- **Google Drive for desktop** (provides the `GoogleDriveFS` process the script pauses)
- Permission to create/write log files under the configured directory

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Copy `userConfig.sample.ps1` to `userConfig.ps1`.
3. Edit `userConfig.ps1` and update:
   - `$syncRoot` and all derived log/output paths
   - `$global:FilePathRemoteFilter` (rclone filter file that scopes which remote folders to process)
   - `$global:DirectoryLocalPictures` (local destination for synced media)
   - Optional flags such as `$global:DryRun` and `$global:Bootstrap`
4. Ensure your rclone remote (`remote:` by default) points at the desired source.
5. Run the sync in **dry-run mode** first (see below) to verify paths and permissions.

## Running the Sync

```powershell
pwsh -File .\pcloud_sync.ps1
```

- When `$global:DryRun` is `$true`, rclone commands are executed with `--dry-run` and copy operations are simulated. This is the safest way to validate your configuration.
- Set `$global:DryRun = $false` for a live run once you are satisfied with the output.
- The script automatically stops the `GoogleDriveFS` process at the start and restarts it when finished.

## Command-Line Parameters

- `-ConfigPath <path>`: Override the path to `userConfig.ps1`. Relative paths are resolved before the script loads configuration.
- `-RemoteName <name>`: Target rclone remote (with or without a trailing colon).
- `-DryRun`: Force dry-run regardless of the configuration file.
- `-LiveRun`: Force a live run even if the configuration file enables dry-run.
- `-SkipProcessControl`: Skip stopping and starting Google Drive File Stream â€” handy for automated tests.

## Logs and Output

- The log destinations are defined in `userConfig.ps1`. By default they write under the directory referenced by `$syncRoot`.
- Each run produces a timestamped dedupe log and appends to the main log.
- Windows Event Log entries are written under the log name specified by `$global:LogName` (defaults to `pcloud_rclone`).

## Tests

Run `pwsh -File tests\Invoke-DryRun.ps1` to execute a guarded dry run. The helper exits early if `userConfig.ps1` is missing and always passes `-SkipProcessControl` so Google Drive File Stream stays untouched.

## Troubleshooting

- If you see `Configuration file '<path>' not found`, make sure you created `userConfig.ps1` from the provided sample.
- Run with `$global:DryRun = $true` to collect diagnostic logs without modifying the remote or local filesystem.
- Review the generated log files for verbose rclone output and elapsed time information.

## Contributing

Contributions and bug reports are welcome! Please open an issue or submit a pull request. Running the sync in dry-run mode is a good sanity check before proposing changes.

## Before Publishing

Before publishing this repository, audit your Git history for secrets, personal data, or log snippets and rewrite/squash as needed. Keep `userConfig.ps1` out of version control.
